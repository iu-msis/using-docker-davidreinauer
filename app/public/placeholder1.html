      <p style="color:black;">  Did you know there are 36 varieties of Michigan Blueberries?! <br>
        Who knew something so small would come in so many flavors and sizes. <br>
        Blueberry season has officially begun in West Michigan so here's a primer on when and where to pick your fill in the Holland area:<br>

        Gold Barn Blueberries north of Holland plants a whopping 12 varieties of berries. <br>
        Their full list with descriptions can be seen here.  Duke and Early Blue are early ripening varieties. <br>
        Collin and Spartans are next. Spartan berries promise to be tangy-sweet and as large as a quarter! <br>
        U-pick price is $1.45 per pound. 15985 Quincy St, 616-399-6267, M-Sa 8am-8pm.<br>

        S. Kamphuis Blueberries is a fourth generation local grower. They plant Bluecrop, Blueray, and Jersey. <br>
        Jerseys are smaller berries but super sweet and great for baking. Kamphuis also has a farm store with jams, <br>
        blueberries treats, and blueberry frozen yogurt which is especially good after a hot day in the field. <br>
        U-pick price is $1.60 per pound. 4140 - 148th Avenue, 616-399-9545, M-F 9am-8pm.<br>

        Bowerman's Blueberries is new to the U-pick market this year. They plant Bluecrop. <br>
        Bowerman's also has a farm store with fresh vegetables, raspberries, and like-you've-never-had-before blueberry donuts. <br>
        U-pick price is $1.60 per pound. 15793 James Street, 616-738-3099, M-Sa 8am-8pm, Su 10am-5pm.<br>

        Wa-Hu Blueberry Farm on Greenly Street plants Duke, Nelson, Blue Ray and Jersey. U-pick price is $1.35 per pound. <br>
        15411 Greenly Street, 616-218-3691, M-Fr 9:30am-4pm.<br>

        Kenny Garden Farms has been growing blueberries since 1948. 15586 Greenly St, 616-994-0447. W-Sa 10am-3pm.<br>

        Blueberry season continues through mid-August depending on the weather and picking volumes. <br>
        Several of these outlets have Facebook pages with updates on what is available to pick and when the season will be closing. <br>
        Blueberries grow in full sun so don't forget the sunscreen and plenty of water!<br>
